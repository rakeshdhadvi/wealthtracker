# Security Documentation

## Overview

WealthTracker is a finance management platform built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. This document outlines our security practices, known issues, and recommendations for maintaining a secure application.

## Security Practices in Place

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Supabase Auth with JWT for secure authentication
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- ✅ Proper user session management
- ✅ Secure password policies
- ✅ Email verification required

### Data Protection
- ✅ HTTPS enforced for all connections
- ✅ Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- ✅ Input validation using Zod
- ✅ XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- ✅ CSRF protection via Supabase's built-in mechanisms

### Database Security
- ✅ RLS policies for all tables
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraints
- ✅ Cascading deletes for user data
- ✅ Prepared statements via PostgREST

## Security Issues & Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **JWT Storage**
   - Issue: JWT tokens stored in localStorage
   - Recommendation: Move to httpOnly cookies with proper CSRF protection
   - Impact: Reduces risk of XSS token theft

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Issue: No rate limiting on auth endpoints
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting for auth and API endpoints
   - Impact: Prevents brute force attacks

3. **Financial Data Encryption**
   - Issue: Sensitive financial data stored in plain text
   - Recommendation: Implement field-level encryption for sensitive financial data
   - Impact: Protects user financial information

### Medium Priority

1. **Input Validation**
   - Issue: Some forms lack comprehensive validation
   - Recommendation: Add Zod schemas for all form inputs
   - Impact: Prevents injection attacks

2. **Error Handling**
   - Issue: Some error messages expose internal details
   - Recommendation: Implement consistent error handling with sanitized messages
   - Impact: Prevents information leakage

3. **Session Management**
   - Issue: No session timeout implementation
   - Recommendation: Add configurable session timeouts
   - Impact: Reduces risk of session hijacking

### Low Priority

1. **Security Headers**
   - Issue: Missing some security headers
   - Recommendation: Add CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
   - Impact: Additional layer of security

2. **Logging**
   - Issue: Insufficient security event logging
   - Recommendation: Implement comprehensive security logging
   - Impact: Better audit trail

## Supabase Configuration

### RLS Policies
```sql
-- Example of proper RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data" ON table_name
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Auth Settings
- Email verification required
- Password minimum length: 8 characters
- JWT expiry: 1 hour
- Refresh token rotation enabled

### Database Settings
- `anon` role has minimal permissions
- RLS enabled on all tables
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Cascading deletes for user data
